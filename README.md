##Title: React portfolio

##Description:

This is my portfolio created with the most modern technologies such as react and react-dom. I also took the opportunity to try out a new CSS framework, Tailwind CSS.
This portfolio is intended to be a way to market myself, to show that I can use and manipulate react and currently popular languages and technologies.
